# Dollar Prediction with Machine Learning

This repository contains a machine learning project that predicts the USD/TRY exchange rate using historical data and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks. The project is developed using Python and Jupyter Notebook.

## Project Overview

The aim of this project is to build a model that can predict future USD/TRY prices based on historical closing prices. The model uses LSTM neural networks, which are suitable for time series analysis.
